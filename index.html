<h1 style="color: cornflowerblue;">My initial idea is to connect <strong> my favorite restaurants, dim sum stores, and cafes </strong> based on the fact that every time I go to these places I am in a happy and joyful mood and full of anticipation. Of course, later on I can add other elements such as <em>parks, art museums, and interviews with my classmates and friends</em>. Eventually I will connect these locations with emotions and create a map driven by different colorful moods.</h1>
<h2>I was first inspired by the pins I placed on Google Maps, where I marked all the restaurants I liked and wanted to visit all in green, a diary-like record. They are now densely overlapping and fill my heart with a delightful sense of accomplishment. I began to ponder the possibility of creating a fun map. This theme allows me to explore how abstract emotions can be translated into visual symbols and images. My interest in psychology and human emotions can also be demonstrated in this project.</h2>
